DQN Atari Code

This module contains the implementation of the Deep Q-Network (DQN) algorithm for training an agent to play Atari games. The DQN algorithm uses a neural network to approximate the Q-value function, which is used to determine the optimal action to take in a given state.

Classes:
    DQNAgent: A class that encapsulates the DQN algorithm, including the neural network, experience replay buffer, and training methods.

Functions:
    train: Trains the DQN agent on the given Atari environment.
    evaluate: Evaluates the performance of the trained DQN agent on the given Atari environment.

Usage:
    # Initialize the DQN agent
    agent = DQNAgent(state_size, action_size)

    # Train the agent
    train(agent, env, num_episodes)

    # Evaluate the agent
    evaluate(agent, env, num_episodes)
